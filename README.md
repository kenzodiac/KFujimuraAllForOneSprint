- "All For One Sprint Day 4"
- This is the fourth part of our All For One Sprint assignment. In this part we finished the JavaScript behavior linking the front-end to the back-end apis. On the whole, this assignment was about creating a website from scratch, including building a series of APIs, hosting them on Azure, and creating an HTML/CSS website that combines JavaScript in order call information from the APIs and display them on the website, reworking old endpoint minichallenges into a functioning full stack HTML website.
